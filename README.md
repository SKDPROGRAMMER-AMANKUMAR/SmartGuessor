This project is a smart number guessing game where the user tries to guess a number between 1 and
100. It gives hints whether the guess is too high or low, tracks attempts, maintains a guess history, and
shows game stats like total games and win rate. We used a class in JavaScript to organize the logic
cleanly, handled button clicks and input events, and updated the UI dynamically. All logic is done with
pure JavaScript without using any external library.
